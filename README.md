# The Purpose Of This Project
  These files are answer to the question in the site, Project Euler.

# The Code
  ## q1.c#
    This code first makes a array that is 1 to 999 and the item is also 1 to 999.
    Then the loops will collect all the multiples of 3 and 5.
    Then the last codes add them all together.
  ## q10_primesum.c#
    The first part of the code gets rid of 1 and 2 because they are a irregular.
    The next function checks either the input number is a prime number or not.
    The last code loops the function and adds the numbers up the same time.
  ## q16_powerdigit.py
    The first code changes the input number into a string.
    The next code checks the lengtt.
    Then the code loop by the length of number.
    The loop divides the next number then adds them together.
  ## q2_fibo.py
    The first code sets the first two numbers in the list to 1 and 2.
    Then the next code does the fibonachi algorithm and makes a fibonachi sequence.
  ## q31_coinsums.py
    The code uses the while loop and starts from the 100 coin to the 1 coin.
    So the code will output the lowest amount of coin that is possible for the price.
  ## q31_different_othercoinsums.py
    This code is a different answer to question 31.
    The code is much shorter because I used calculation to figure the answer.
  ## q45_testfortripenthex.py
    This code is a test for the answer for question 45.
    The code checks if the three functions are properly working.
  ## q45_tripenthex.py
    I first calculated all triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers up to one hundred thousand using the function I made.
    Then I used the "in" function to check if there is the same triangular number in the two lists.
    Finally the code ouptputs the number.
  ## q5.py
    The program searches for the first number i that is divisibly the numbers from 1 to 20.
